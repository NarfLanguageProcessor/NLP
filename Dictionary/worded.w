{"index": 367415, "D": "a unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or their written representation, that functions as a principal carrier of meaning. Words are composed of one or more morphemes and are either the smallest units susceptible of independent use or consist of two or three such units combined under certain linking conditions, as with the loss of primary accent that distinguishes the one-word blackbird (primary stress on \u201cblack\u201d, and secondary stress on \u201cbird\u201d) from black bird (primary stress on both words). Words are usually separated by spaces in writing, and are distinguished phonologically, as by accent, in many languages.", "S": ["couch", "formulate", "frame", "present", "put", "say", "term", "utter", "voice", "word"], "A": ["take"]}
