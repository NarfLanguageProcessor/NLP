It is also used to form nouns from words other than verbs (offing; shirting). Verbal nouns ending in -ing are often used attributively (the printing trade) and in forming compounds (drinking song). In some compounds (sewing machine), the first element might reasonably be regarded as the participial adjective, -ing2,  the compound thus meaning \u201ca machine that sews,\u201d but it is commonly taken as a verbal noun, the compound being explained as \u201ca machine for sewing.\u201d", "S": ["computer-generated", "virtual"], "A": ["in reality"]}
