During the process, the surface to be covered acts as a cathode in an electrolytic cell, and the metal that is to cover it acts as an anode. Electroplating is usually used to cover a less expensive metal with a more expensive metal, or to cover a corrosive metal with a less corrosive or noncorrosive metal.", "S": ["anodize", "bronze", "chrome", "cover", "electroplate", "enamel", "encrust", "face", "flake", "foil", "gild", "laminate", "layer", "nickel", "overlay", "platinize", "scale", "silver", "stratify"], "A": []}
